# Networking Project with Cisco Packet Tracer

This project showcases a small-scale network design using Cisco Packet Tracer, emphasizing subnetting techniques to optimize network performance and efficiency. It includes multiple switches and routers configured to demonstrate practical networking skills.

## Project Overview

In this project, I created a network with two subnets from a single IP address block. The goal was to enhance my understanding of subnetting and apply this knowledge to configure network devices for efficient data communication.

## Key Features

- **Network Design:** Developed a small-scale network using Cisco Packet Tracer, incorporating multiple switches and routers.
- **Subnetting:** Divided the network into two subnets, ensuring efficient use of IP addresses and improved network performance.
- **Configuration:** Configured network devices to support seamless data transmission and communication within the network.

## Subnetting Details

- **Original Network:** 192.168.40.0/24
- **Number of Subnets:** 2
- **Subnet Mask:** 255.255.255.128

### Subnet Breakdown

1. **1st Subnet:**
   - **Network ID:** 192.168.40.0
   - **Valid Host Range:** 192.168.40.1 - 192.168.40.126
   - **Broadcast IP:** 192.168.40.127

2. **2nd Subnet:**
   - **Network ID:** 192.168.40.128
   - **Valid Host Range:** 192.168.40.129 - 192.168.40.254
   - **Broadcast IP:** 192.168.40.255

## Tools and Technologies

- **Cisco Packet Tracer:** Used for network simulation and configuration.
- **Subnetting Techniques:** Applied to efficiently divide and manage the network.

## Learning Outcomes

- Gained hands-on experience in network design and configuration.
- Enhanced understanding of subnetting and its practical applications.
- Developed skills in using Cisco Packet Tracer for network simulation.

## Conclusion
