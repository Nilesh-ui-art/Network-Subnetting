# Network-Subnetting
Created a small-scale network using Cisco Packet Tracer, focusing on subnetting for optimal performance. Configured multiple switches and routers to divide the network into two subnets, enhancing IP address efficiency. This project deepened my understanding of network design, configuration, and subnetting techniques.
